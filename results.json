Rainy weather may reduce attendance, further skewing supply-demand.  \n2. **Perishability**: Likely perishable (e.g., cheese boards, cold cuts, desserts), raising spoilage concerns post-event.  \n3. **Urgency**: Moderate\u2014non-perishables (e.g., packaged snacks) can wait, but perishables require swift redistribution within 24\u201348 hours to avoid waste. Prioritize cold items first."

      "surplus_score": 1.0,
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "**Analysis:**  \n1. **Surplus Factors:** The buffet setup encourages over-ordering to ensure enough food, while the 6-hour duration and mild weather (which likely boosted attendance) increase the risk of leftover perishables.  \n2. **Perishability:** Beverages (non-perishable) and snacks (mix of perishable [fresh items] and non-perishable [packaged]).  \n3. **Urgency:** High for perishable snacks; beverages can be stored longer. Redistribute perishables ASAP to avoid waste."

      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "1. **Factors suggesting surplus**: High attendee count (1,214) and buffet-style catering create excess risk, compounded by a long 6-hour duration. Cold weather may reduce attendance, increasing surplus likelihood.  \n2. **Food type**: Breakfast items and pastries are perishable (e.g., dairy-based pastries, bread), requiring timely redistribution.  \n3. **Urgency**: High\u2014perishables lose value quickly, necessitating rapid donation or repurposing to minimize waste."

      "reasoning": "**Analysis:**  \n1. **Surplus Factors:** The buffet style and 6-hour duration increase waste likelihood, as attendees may leave excess food. Rainy weather could reduce attendance or appetite, compounding surplus.  \n2. **Perishability:** Pizza and pasta are semi-perishable (safe for hours but degrade in quality), requiring timely redistribution.  \n3. **Urgency:** Moderate urgency\u2014redistribution should occur within 4\u20136 hours post-event to avoid spoilage, especially if weather impacts attendance.  \n\n**Prediction:** High surplus potential due to buffet waste patterns and weather-related attendance risks."

The 4-hour duration may also contribute to excess food being left uneaten.  \n2. While snacks and beverages are mostly non-perishable, some items (e.g., fresh pastries, dairy-based drinks) may have limited shelf life, requiring prompt redistribution.  \n3. Urgency is moderate: non-perishable items can be stored, but perishables should be redistributed within 24 hours to avoid waste. Rainy weather might reduce attendance slightly, further increasing surplus potential."
