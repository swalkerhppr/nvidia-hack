      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "1. The large attendee count (1671) and buffet catering type increase surplus likelihood, as buffets often lead to overproduction. The 7-hour duration further raises waste potential due to extended service time.  \n2. Since the event focuses on appetizers and finger foods (typically non-perishable or shelf-stable items like crackers, chips, or pre-packaged snacks), perishability is lower, but fresh options (e.g., cut fruits) could still spoil.  \n3. Urgency is moderate: non-perishable items allow slower redistribution, but perishables require prompt action. Rainy weather may reduce attendance, slightly easing demand."

      "surplus_score": 1.0,
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "1340 attendees with a buffet catering style over 6 hours create high surplus potential due to the self-service nature encouraging over-serving. With mild weather ensuring good attendance, the combination of snacks (perishable) and beverages (non-perishable) means significant waste likely occurs, particularly with snack items. Redistribution urgency is moderate-high as perishable snacks may need timely handling, though beverages can be stored longer."

Breakfast items and pastries are moderately perishable (short shelf life if left unrefrigerated), raising waste concerns.  \n3. Urgency is moderate: surplus should be redistributed within 2-4 hours post-event to minimize spoilage, especially in cold weather where attendance may dip but leftovers could still spoil quickly."

Pizza and pasta are semi-perishable (safe for 2-3 days), allowing moderate redistribution urgency.  \n3. Rainy weather may reduce attendance, but 6-hour duration and buffet style still suggest potential surplus needing prompt action."

The rainy weather may reduce attendance slightly, further increasing surplus likelihood. Since beverages and many snacks are non-perishable, urgency for redistribution is moderate but should still be addressed within 1-2 days to avoid waste."
